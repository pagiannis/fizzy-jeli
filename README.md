## Features

- **Dynamic Forms with Validation**: Built using [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) and [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for fast, reliable, and typesafe form handling.
- **Server Communication**: Uses [react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/framework/react/overview) and [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) to handle data fetching, mutations, and caching with automatic retries and error handling.
- **Responsive and Modern Design**: Interactive Jelly-UI animations and responsive, modern UI design.
- **Routing**: Client-side routing is handled through [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com).
- **Reusable UI Components**: Custom-designed and reusable components for consistency and modularity across the app.
- **Clean Architecture**: The app meets the demands of the **sOc (Separation of Concerns)** protocol, with logic cleanly separated between UI, logic, and data layers.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the project**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pagiannis/fizzy-jeli.git
cd fizzy-jeli
```

2. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up the backend**:

This project depends on a separate backend API. You can find it here:
[fizzy-jeli-api](https://github.com/pagiannis/fizzy-jeli-api).

Follow the setup instructions in that repository to start the API server locally (usually runs at http://localhost:3000 or similar).

Make sure the backend is running before starting the frontend.

4. **Set up .env file**:

Create a .env file inside the fizy-jeli folder with the following:

```env
VITE_API_CLIENT_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:3000/api'
FRONTEND_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:5173'
```

5. **Run the app**:

```bash
npm run dev
```
