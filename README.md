## Features

- **Dynamic Forms with Validation**: Built using [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) and [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for fast, reliable, and typesafe form handling.
- **Server Communication**: Uses [react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/framework/react/overview) and [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) to handle data fetching, mutations, and caching with automatic retries and error handling.
- **Responsive and Modern Design**: Interactive Jelly-UI animations and responsive, modern UI design.
- **Routing**: Client-side routing is handled through [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com).
- **Reusable UI Components**: Custom-designed and reusable components for consistency and modularity across the app.
- **Clean Architecture**: The app meets the demands of the **sOc (Separation of Concerns)** protocol, with logic cleanly separated between UI, logic, and data layers.
